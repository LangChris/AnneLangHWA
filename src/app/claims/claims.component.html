<p>As we are all currently witnessing, the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 pandemic are changing by the hour. For this very reason, it is essential during this unprecedented time that we band together as a community – remaining steadfast in our commitment to the health and wellbeing of homeowners, our service contractors and our staff.</p>
<p>As a valued customer and member of the HWA community, your safety and peace of mind are of the utmost important to us. Due to government health and safety directives and/or other events beyond our control related to COVID-19, we are currently prioritizing high-risk, emergency claims, such as total loss of air conditioning/ heat emergencies in extreme weather, inability to have access to running water or excessive water leak that cannot be shut off.</p>
<p>We also want to assure you that all customer claims are important to us and we will do our best to resolve all other claims as soon as we possibly can; however, some customers may experience service delays. Current or future government restrictions in some areas may prevent service providers from promptly responding to claims.</p>
